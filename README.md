### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Zhaoping Wang. An Architectual Designing college student from Henan University of Technology.

Not an architect, nor an architecture designer.

I upload and open-source my projects from my designing courses.

## Do I write codes? 

I did, before the college. I wrote easy pieces, but not here.

## Why using GitHub to save your homework?

Yup, 'cuz I just wanted to and I probably don't have a better place to do this elsewhere. And this platform is familiar to me.

Update: Probably not in the future, as the files is getting bigger, I can't upload file bigger than 100 MB. I'm considering other way to do it.

## Future Plans?

I would do some 3D-printing later, so I will also open-source those 3D-modeling files I do in the future.
